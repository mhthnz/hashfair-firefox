                    <h3>What this extension does?</h3>
                    It helps to analyse your payout data to help you more accurately estimate your profit on HashFlare.
                    The default chart doesn't show you how much BTC was charged for maintenance and electricity fee.
                    Also, it shows your balance and daily payout in USD according today\'s approximate market price.

                    <h3>What is "clear" payout?</h3>
                    "Clear" payout shows how much BTC added to your balance after maintenance and electricity fee.
                    These fees have fixed price in USD, but are charging in BTC. So amount of "clear" payout depends on
                    BTC/USD rate.
